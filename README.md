# PYTHON-project-2
This is my second python project which is basically a number game named Fermi Pico Bagel
The the game begins with device randomly choosing a number with no repeated 3 digits.
The users attempt to guess the number, and the one who chose the number responds to each guess as follows:
• If the guess has no numbers correct, they respond: "Bagel."
• For each digit the guess has correct, but in the wrong place, they respond: "Pico."
• For each digit the guess has correct and in the correct place, they respond: "Fermi."
